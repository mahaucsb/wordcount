wordcount
=========

Reusable Hadoop wordcount program. This is a quick version to allow you to compile any java program easily and produce a runnable jar file with one command.
Make sure you have "ant" installed and you'll be ready to try. 

1) cd wordcount/
2) ant

This should create a target/wordcount.jar file in your current path.
